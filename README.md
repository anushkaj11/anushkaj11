### About me

I am a materials scientist and engineer with a passion for soft matter research. My expertise lies in rheology and adhesion. For my PhD thesis, I was advised by Dr. Joelle Frechette at Johns Hopkins University. My thesis looked at adhesion of slippery fluid infused surfaces in contact with soft adhesives. I completed my Master's thesis on microrheology of complex fluids with Dr. Y.M. Joshi and Dr. Debabrata Goswami at IIT Kanpur.
As a scientist, I am truly fascinated by the diverse range of behaviors exhibited by soft materials - viscoelasticity, granular mechanics, interfacial phenomena, self-assembly - the list goes on. As an engineer, I see these behaviors pieces of a giant puzzle - that can be assembled to address plethora of problems.
